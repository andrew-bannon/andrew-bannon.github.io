<h1>Hockey</h1>

<img src="IMG_2490.jpeg">

<p>I grew up playing the sport of hockey. My father brought me to loving this game back in 2006 and since then I have always been anticipating the next fall for the start of hockey season. I have played for 3 different organizations growing up, Southeastern Seahawks, South Windsor Knights, and the Eastern Connecticut Redhawks. Hockey has really became a part of my life to the point where I can't live without it. My whole life is based around hockey and getting invlved any way possible. In my future I plan to coach my own team and future children through the sport I love.</p>

<h1>Lacrosse</h1>

<p>This sport I got into late into my childhood. I grew to admire this sport and am playing on the University of Maine club lacrosse team. I only played for my town and my high school playing four years of varsity for this sport I felt not too great at. I took an opposite turn when I started playing defense instead of offense. In hockey I was a forward and was the key to offense for any team I played for and lacrosse I was back on defense leading the team on the back end protecting our goal. This change made me appreciate the game more and really helped me find what to strive for in the future when it comes to this sport. </p>
